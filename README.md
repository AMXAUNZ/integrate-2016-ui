User Interfaces shown at Integrate 2016

These user interfaces were shown at the Integrate 2016 as examples of simple and intuitive user interface and interaction design.

They were envisioned and created by graphic designers independently of the technical AV team, who in turn transformed the reulting layered images into touch panel design files for use with the Modero X Series 10.1" table-top touch panels.

This repository contains screenshots, touch panel design files, resource images, and the original layered Photoshop files.
